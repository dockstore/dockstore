ICGC on the cloud goes live and is described on the AWS Blog at [New AWS Public Data Sets – TCGA and ICGC](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-aws-public-data-sets-tcga-and-icgc/) and can be visualized at [ICGC on the Amazon Cloud](https://dcc.icgc.org/icgc-in-the-cloud/aws)

The first workflow used to generate this dataset, BWA, is posted on Dockstore as a [CWL tool](https://dockstore.org/containers/quay.io/pancancer/pcawg-bwa-mem-workflow).
