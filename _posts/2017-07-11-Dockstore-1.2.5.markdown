Visit our [new forum](https://discuss.dockstore.org/). Discuss tools, tooling, bioinformatics cloud computing, etc. This will replace both the private OICR-based mailing list and the Disqus integration that we've been using to provide discussion and commenting on tools respectively.

Additionally, our hotfix release (with a few hidden features to be formally released later) includes fixes for the following:
 
* File provisioning changes to support GA4GH-DREAM workflows including whole directory provision 
* Fixes for workflow parameter json creation and CWL download
* Several file provisioning fixes based on user feedback
* Issues saving workflow test json files

### Breaking Changes

* We needed to clear out unpublished workflows to do some clean-up. Let us know if you had anything important stored in unpublished as opposed to published workflows.
* Potentially breaking, if a destination is not specified for a particular file, by default we will provision it to the current working directory after a warning

See more details on [GitHub](https://github.com/ga4gh/dockstore/milestone/12).
