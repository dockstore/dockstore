We're hard at work on the next major version of Dockstore. 

In the meantime, our hotfix release includes fixes for the following:
* fixes for file provisioning with the [GA4GH/DREAM challenge](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn8507133/wiki/415976) series of workflows
* spelling and verbiage fixes, some contributed from our users
* fixes for display of test files and registry locations
* fixes for consistency with the GA4GH Tool Registry Schema

Plus the following small features
* browsing tools and workflows defaults to popularity order (starring), allowing popular tools and workflows to rise to the top
* new documentation sections highlighting posters that mention Dockstore and software projects that use or integrate with Dockstore
