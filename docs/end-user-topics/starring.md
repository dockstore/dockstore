# Starring Tools and Workflows
If you find a tool or a workflow interesting and want to keep track of it, you can star it. You can see all of your starred entries on the [starred page](https://dockstore.org/starred). This is in the account dropdown on the top right of the page.


## How To Star an Entry
To star an entry, go to the public page of a tool or workflow and click on the star button. Beside the star is another button which shows the number of users who have also starred the entry. Clicking on the button will bring you to a page where you can view all the users who have also starred the entry.

## Other Reasons To Star an Entry
Starring also gives an indication for how popular a tool or workflow is. When searching for tools and workflows you can sort by the number of stars. This means that starring is a good way to tell developers that you like their tool or workflow. This also tells the community that the entry is likely of better quality.
