# actionOnlyInformation contains information necessary for the GitHub action to run,
# but not useful to an end user

# setupInformation contains two different keys,
# 1. Text
#   This is displayed only in README.md and is pasted exactly into README.md, this means
#   that any md formatting must be made to the text in the text field.
#   For example:
#   text: ### This is a heading
#
# 2. Code
#   The key run is the only field pasted into README.md. All the fields are added
#   to the end of the steps in macos_installation_instruction.yml.
#   NOTE: Do not have multiline code, this will cause problems for github actions, instead use ';'s
#   scripts/macos-instructions.sh will substitute each ';' for a new line in README.md.
#   NOTE: "|| true" will be removed from the code shown on README.md
