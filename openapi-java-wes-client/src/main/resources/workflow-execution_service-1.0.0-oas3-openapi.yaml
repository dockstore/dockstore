      summary: Run a workflow.
      description: >-
        This endpoint creates a new workflow run and returns a `RunId` to
        monitor its progress.


        The `workflow_attachment` array may be used to upload files that are
        required to execute the workflow, including the primary workflow, tools
        imported by the workflow, other files referenced by the workflow, or
        files which are part of the input.  The implementation should stage
        these files to a temporary directory and execute the workflow from
        there. These parts must have a Content-Disposition header with a
        "filename" provided for each part.  Filenames may include
        subdirectories, but must not include references to parent directories
        with '..' -- implementations should guard against maliciously
        constructed filenames.


        The `workflow_url` is either an absolute URL to a workflow file that is
        accessible by the WES endpoint, or a relative URL corresponding to one
        of the files attached using `workflow_attachment`.


        The `workflow_params` JSON object specifies input parameters, such as
        input files.  The exact format of the JSON object depends on the
        conventions of the workflow language being used.  Input files should
        either be absolute URLs, or relative URLs corresponding to files
        uploaded using `workflow_attachment`.  The WES endpoint must understand
        and be able to access URLs supplied in the input.  This is
        implementation specific.


        The `workflow_type` is the type of workflow language and must be "CWL"
        or "WDL" currently (or another alternative  supported by this WES
        instance).


        The `workflow_type_version` is the version of the workflow language
        submitted and must be one supported by this WES instance.


        See the `RunRequest` documentation for details about other fields.

      default: UNKNOWN
      description: >-
        - UNKNOWN: The state of the task is unknown. This provides a safe
        default for messages where this field is missing, for example, so that a
        missing field does not accidentally imply that the state is QUEUED.


         - QUEUED: The task is queued.


        - INITIALIZING: The task has been assigned to a worker and is currently
        preparing to run. For example, the worker may be turning on, downloading
        input files, etc.


        - RUNNING: The task is running. Input files are downloaded and the first
        Executor has been started.


        - PAUSED: The task is paused. An implementation may have the ability to
        pause a task, but this is not required.


         - COMPLETE: The task has completed running. Executors have exited without error
        and output files have been successfully uploaded.


         - EXECUTOR_ERROR: The task encountered an error in one of the Executor processes. Generally,
        this means that an Executor exited with a non-zero exit code.


         - SYSTEM_ERROR: The task was stopped due to a system error, but not from an Executor,
        for example an upload failed due to network issues, the worker's ran out
        of disk space, etc.


         - CANCELED: The task was canceled by the user.


          - CANCELING: The task was canceled by the user, and is in the process of stopping.
